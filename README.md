# AI Text Classification and Evaluation 

AI Text Classifier & Evaluator is a web application that utilizes binary text classification and a supervised learning model to classify a text sequence into one of two classes. The AI model utilizes various techniques & algorithms such as TF-IDF and Decision Tree to ensure reliable and precise classification results. Additionally, The web application also provides an interactive evaluation of the text classifier's performance. The user uploads a text document (webpage, tweet, docx file, URL, etc.), which is then processed by the classifier. The resulting classification is displayed to the user, with relevant keywords highlighted. Users can agree/disagree with the result, add/remove highlights, and save the classified text with annotations for future reference.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project (Text-Classification-and-Evaluation) directory, run:

### `npm run install-all`

This command runs `npm install` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all project dependencies. 

### `npm install` & `pip install -r requirements.txt`

If the above command does not work, run `npm install` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside ***Text-Classification-and-Evaluation*** directory and `cd client` directory and run `npm install` again.

### `npm run dev` 

To "concurrently" run client & server. Make sure to run this command inside of project (***Text-Classification-and-Evaluation***) directory

### `node server.js`

To just run the server.\
Open [http://localhost:5002](http://localhost:5002) to view it in your browser.

### `npm start`

Runs the client app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
